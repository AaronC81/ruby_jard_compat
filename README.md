# ruby_jard Compatibility Fork

This is a work-in-progress fork of the excellent [ruby_jard debugger](https://github.com/nguyenquangminh0711/ruby_jard), **modified with added support for Windows, and a lowered minimum language version of Ruby 2.2!**

The debugger launches and the REPL works, but navigation keybinds are broken and there are some layout/colour issues.

## Installation

This isn't on RubyGems yet - you'll need to clone it and build the gem. Once installed, the gem is still called `ruby_jard`.
